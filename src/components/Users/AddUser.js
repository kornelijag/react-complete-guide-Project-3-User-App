import React, {useState} from "react";

  const [enteredAge, setEnteredAge] = useState('');

/*
Notes:

1) htmlFor and id attributes:

htmlFor is the JSX alternative of the "for" attribute in HTML.
"for" in HTML is an attribute used with the label tag
to indicate which input element the label is for.

This goes together with the id attribute on an input elemement like so:
<label htmlFor="idOfInputElement"></label>
<input id="idOfInputElement"/>

We don't have to set these attributes, but it is good for accessibility
reasons. For example, for screen readers to understand 
which label belongs to which input.


2) event.preventDefault();

For submitting a form, intuituively we'd think 
of adding an onClick event listener property on the button 
meant to submit the form.
But we don't do that because there is a default behavior in the browser
for form submission events that is implemented by adding an onSubmit 
event listener property on the <form> itself and by adding type="submit"
on the <button> meant to submit it.

Unfortunately, a part of this default form submission behavior 
is a request being sent to the web app's hosting server 
(in this case the development server), which makes the page reload.
We don't need this so we prevent it.

3) className on custom component <Card>:

We don't have to call this property className,
but we are choosing to, because that's also what's used
on built-in components like <div>.

4) State:

To use a concept called State we need to import and use the React hook useState().
It is one of the most important and commonly used hooks in React.

-Why do we want to use this concept?
useState() allows React to run the component function again when it needs to.
We mainly need that to have a dynamic UI, where an event makes changes to the screen.

-How does it work and what does it consist of?

When we call useState() we need to pass in an initial value called default state value 
as an argument. The reason is because behind the scenes useState creates a special variable
that needs an initial value. 

It is special because changes to it lead to the component function being called again.
We can't access this special variable directly, but React provides us with a pointer to it
to use its value, and with a special function to make changes to it.

The special function does not only change the value of the special variable. It also
triggers a re-render cycle by making the component function execute again, 
so that the UI is updated.

Calling useState() always returns an array of exactly two elements:
1) a pointer to the special variable (the value it holds)
also referred to as the current state snapshot;
2) a state updating function.

That is why we use array destructuring to save them in two constants like so:
const [varName, funcName] = useState('initial value');

The common naming conventions are as follows:
const [var, setVar] = useState('initial value');

Note: If I'm not mistaken the only reason we need State variables enteredUsername and enteredAge
is for being able to clear form input fields. Since that does require a UI change.

5) Event object:

An event object describes an event that occurred.

In React an event handler function receives a default event object 
as an argument from the browser when our event is triggered, 
and then the handler function uses the received event object 
to store information about the event.
In order for a handler function to receive it we simply need to
add it as an argument like so:

const eventHandlerFn = (event) => {
      console.log(event);
  }

To see what's inside this object we can simply log it as done above.

We can inspect specific information by using the dot syntax
to access specific properties of the event object.
We can see all of its properties when we expand the logged 
event object. We will see it called SyntheticBaseEvent in the log.


What stored information might we specifically
be interested in?

We can use the event object to save input from the user.
For example, to save the value that was entered by the user into 
an input field (the <input> element).

For that we have to have an event listener property such as onChange, onInput, onClick, etc. 
on the element that receives the input (such as <input>), and have it set to a pointer to an event handler function.
The handler function must have an event argument to receive the event object from the browser
when the event fires.
Then we can access the input value by going event.target.value

The target property points at the DOM element on which we are listening for the event.
Reminder: we listen to events via event listener properties that start with 'on',
such as onClick, onChange, etc.
So if the listener is on an <input> element, the the target refers to that particular <input> element.

Depending on what the DOM element is, the target object might contain
different properties that we can inspect by expanding the target in the log.
But for elements that accept input we typically just want the value property.


6) Form input resetting:

Logic for resetting form input is easy.

It only comes in two steps:
   1. Make <input> element value property dependent on the appropriate State variable, for example:
       <input id="username" type="text" onChange={usernameChangeHandler} value={enteredUsername}/>
   2. Now that the <input> element's value depends on the value of the assigned State variable,
      just change the value of that State variable to an empty string in the event handler that fires
      during form submission, so that the input field empties when the form is submitted.

That's it.

Q: A question that might arise is, but what about saving the input?
Aren't we using these State variables (in this case enteredUsername, enteredAge)
for saving the user's input?
If so, then isn't it counter-intuitive to first save the user's entered value in 
a state variable just to clear it right after to clear the input field?

A: Actually no.
If I'm not mistaken the only reason we really need State variables enteredUsername and enteredAge
is for being able to clear form input fields. Since that does require a UI change.
And even if we initially do save the user's values inside these State variables,
that's only temporary since we have to pass these values onto a list of Users.

7) Form validation:

This can be done using an IF inside the event handler function that fires
when the form is submitted. We can return an error message or an empty return.
We should have an IF statement for every error message, if we're returning errror messages.
But we can firstly just make empty returns, and create error modals later.

Do it right after this line:
event.preventDefault();

Now whatever happens during form submission will only happen if the input is valid.

8) Numeric input:

Anything that is entered as input is always received as a string.
That is just how JS and the HTML DOM work.

But for validation we may need to convert the string input 
containing a numeric value into a number.

The easiest way to do that is to simply at a + sign before the string
or the variable containing the string.

E.g.,
if (+enteredAge < 1){
      return;
    }


9) Outputting and managing list - where to do so?

Let's divide this into two questions:
1. Where should we output our list of items? (List of users in this case)
2. And where should we manage it? 
The answer to the second question depends on the answer to the first one.

Since we get the user data here in the AddUser component,
technically we could simply add more JSX code in that component to render a list.
Perhaps here under the form:
        </form>
      <ul></ul> <-- list here
    </Card>

We could manage this list within this same component with useState().

This is something we could do and technically it would work.
But we will not be doing it here because it is best to keep components 
smaller and more focused so that each has its own task and responsibility.

So it's best to have:
  - one component that fetches user input (that's this AddUser component)
  - another component for outputting the list of items (users).
This way we split the outputting and the fetching logic into two components.

And therefore we will add a new component into the User folder:
UserList.js - it will be responsible for outputting user data

Where will we use <UsersList> then?

We could technically use it in this component (AddUser.js) here:
        </form>
      <UsersList /> <-- here
    </Card>

But from a component structure perspective this doesn't make sense
because this component, AddUser.js., as the name itself suggests is for
adding new users, that is, accepting new data for adding new users. 
The name does not suggest that we are outputting data here
so it makes more sense to use it in a different component.

It makes sense to add it in App.js next to <AddUser>
like so:

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AddUser />
      <UsersList />
    </div>
  );
}


10) Choosing a component that will manage the Stateful List

(In this case a list of users.)

So far when the form submit button is pressed,
in the addUserHandler we only log the user's entered data.

Now, instead of just logging it, we want to:
   1 - create a new user object with that data,
   2 - add it to an array of users object, which we then output in the UsersList component.


The question is, where do we create and manage the stateful array object?

We need to keep in mind that we need to pass the array of users
to the <UsersList> component in App.js, since that is the component
responsible for outputting the users' data.

Bearing that in mind, we need to decide which
component should be used to create and manage the users array.

In any case we have 3 components
that communicate together to accept new data and output it:
          App.js 
          (parent)
          /    \
         /      \
  <AddUser>     <UsersList>
  (child)         (child)

Technically either one of these three components
could be used to create and manage the state.
But depending on which the component is used for that, the trajectory
of communication will be different,
and in some cases the trajectory will turn out to be longer than in others.

When thinking about this we need to bear in mind that in React
direct bottom-up (child-to-parent) communication is not possible.
So to lift data up from child to parent we need the parent
to pass down a callback function (pointer to it) to the child component,
via props and have the child component pass data to it.
(That's why it is sometimes said that in React there is only top-down communication.)

Trajectory (or Access to other components)

In terms of trajectory, what would be the most logical?
Well, keeping the array in either AddUser or UsersList doesn't really 
make sense because they both need acces to the array, but they don't have 
direct access to each other.
So for AddUser to pass something to UsersList and vice versa, that data
would always need to go through App.js, the parent component, making the
data travelling "distance" longer each time.

Then, what makes more sense is to keep the array inside App.js,
since App.js has direct access to both AddUser and UsersList.

Responsibilities

What makes the decision (where to create and manage the array)
easiest is thinking in terms of responsibilities.
Reminder: It's best to keep components small and focused,
ideally with one responsibility for each.

Let's list these 3 components with their responsibilities:
App.js - ?
AddUser - receive input for list
UsersList - output list contents

It looks like App.js is the only one that doesn't have a responsibility 
(aside from starting the app, but in this context it doesn't really count).
And since it has direct access to both AddUser and UsersList (both which will need access to the array), 
it makes the most sense to let App.js create and manage the users array. :) 

Which means:
 1 - We'll create the users array in App.js,
and create a callback function which will be used to add more elements.
 2 - The callback function will be passed via props down to AddUser.js,
and AddUser.js will pass a new user object into this function as an argument.
 3 - Then, App.js will pass a pointer to the array to UsersList.js for display of the list.

During the bottom-up communication from <AddUser> to App.js we will also have to
use the concept of "Lifting the state up". Check comments in App.js.
